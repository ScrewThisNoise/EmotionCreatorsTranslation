# EmotionCreators English Translation
This is an English-language translation of the Illusion eroge EmotionCreators. By making use of [BepInEx v5.x](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) and [AutoTranslator](https://github.com/bbepis/XUnity.AutoTranslator), the translation does not need to overwrite any game files and is easily modified. This translation is based on English translation for Koikatu! which is Illusion's previous game.

## How to install
1. Install latest version of [BepInEx v5](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) and [AutoTranslator](https://github.com/bbepis/XUnity.AutoTranslator).
2. Remove your `BepInEx\Translations` folder if it exists.
3. Download latest release from the "Releases" tab and extract it to your game directory. If asked, overwrite old files.
4. Start the game, click Play, and then press F3 to open the tutorial. Everything should be properly translated now.
